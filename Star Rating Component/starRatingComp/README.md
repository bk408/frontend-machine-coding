# 💡 Problem Statement: Implement Interactive Star Rating System

# Description: 🌟We're crafting a dynamic star rating system for user interaction on our platform. Here's what we need:

Hover Effect: 🖱️ When a user hovers over a star, it should sparkle with a different hue to indicate selection.

Persistent Rating: 🌟 Once the user selects a star (by clicking), the choice should remain until the user decides otherwise.

Ease of Modification: 🔄 Users should effortlessly tweak their rating by clicking on a different star.
