💡 Problem: 🚚 Moving Data Between Lists

⚡ Description: 📊 You have data shown on the left side of the screen. Users can pick items from one side and move them to the other side, and vice versa.

Requirements:

1. Visual Clarity: 👁️‍🗨️ When users select an item, it should change color so they know what they've picked.
2. Starting Point: 🏁 All items should start on the left side when the page loads.
3. Moving Items: 🖱️ Users should be able to click a button to move selected items from one side to the other. After moving, the item should go back to its original color to show it's been moved successfully.
4. Two-Way Transfer: ↔️ Users should be able to move items back and forth between the sides as needed.
